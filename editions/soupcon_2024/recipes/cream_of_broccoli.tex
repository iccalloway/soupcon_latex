\recipe{Cream of Broccoli Soup}
{Annie Else}
{This recipe is from my grandmother Sharon Rocker. She recently passed away, so when I was considering soup recipes I immediately thought about honoring her recipes and cooking traditions. She made this broccoli soup for Christmas every year, so it is quite nostalgic for me. I will even be using her hand-written recipe card to recreate this. This will be my first time making it on my own! While it is a pretty simple soup in terms of ingredients, it is very comforting and makes a great starter to a meal.
