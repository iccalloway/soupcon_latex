\recipe{Søtsuppe}
{Allison Lawrence}
{What is soup? According to Webster's dictionary, it is simply “liquid food." For many humans, however, soup is so much more. It is laughter around a family dinner table, comfort during snowy months; it’s creativity and ingenuity in the face of hardship. With this soup, I hope to capture the whole essence of soup, to unify its myriad themes into one toothsome bowl. As I sought pureed perfection, my research led me outside the confines of my home country. I found it in my sister’s home of Norway in the form of Søtsuppe, a sweet dessert soup evoking a grandmother’s loving caress and a child’s lust for sugar. Though preliminary findings indicate my sister has never heard of søtsuppe (nor have any of her friends), I am hopeful that through continued simmering efforts, this platonic ideal of soup-dom will change the discourse around so-called “liquid food” for generations to come.}
