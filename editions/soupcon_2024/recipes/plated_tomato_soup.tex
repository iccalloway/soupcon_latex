\recipe{Plated Tomato Soup}
{Lia Boyle}
{I wrote a detailed response to this but google did not save the progress so the resulting substitution will be comparatively brief. Recipe from a meal service box when I lived in NYC. Initially accompanied by three-cheese grilled cheese (cheddar, fontina, gouda) made with truffle oil. Do not recommend substituting canned jalapeños for the canned tomatoes}
{ % Ingredients Command
    \ingredients{
\item[] \underline{Soup}
\item 8oz vegetable stock
\item 1 28oz can tomatoes (best with fire roasted)
\item 1 tsp sugar
\item 2 Tbsp heavy cream (plus probably some more)
\item 1/4c grated hard cheese (Trader Joes black pepper toscano is my favorite)
\item 1/4 tsp crushed red pepper
\item salt, pepper
\item a handful of basil \\\\
\underline{Cheese Dreams (name and initial recipe c/o NYT)}
\item 1 loaf bread, sliced
\item 8oz shredded cheese (at least half should be sharp cheddar; can mix in some habanero jack or if you're me, 'mexican cheese blend' from Trader Joe's)
\item 8oz (2 sticks/1 cup) butter, softened
\item 1 egg
\item 1/4c heavy cream, room temp
\item 1 1/2tsp Worcestershire sauce 
\item 1 tsp garlic powder
\item 1/2 tsp mustard powder
\item salt to taste
\item hot sauce to taste (I like it with Old Bay hot sauce, but that's the Marylander in me. Fun fact: I saw that for the first time in MI in Busch’s and had never seen in MD.)
\item smoked paprika if fancy

\item[] \underline{Soup}
\item Combine stock, entire can of tomatoes, sugar and 1c water. Bring to a boil on high, then reduce to medium and simmer ~15-20m. 
\item When checking on soup mid simmer, add crushed red pepper, salt to taste, pepper
\item Once soup is a bit thicker, add grated cheese and 2 Tbsp heavy cream. Remove from heat. Chiffonade basil and mix half with the warm soup.
\item If you want smooth soup, use immersion blender (or real blender) to make even consistency. Once fully blended, can add more cream to desired shade of salmon/coral/red. Drizzle a little bit of plain cream on top.  Top with the other half of the chiffonaded basil. \\\\

\underline{Cheese Dreams}
\item Preheat oven to 375F if baking today; line baking sheet with parchment or tin foil or something where you can peel off errant toasted cheese for a snack.
\item Cut crusts off bread, save them. If 'sandwich bread' shaped, cut crustless slice into 4 squares. It works best if you cut two slices together (one stacked on top of the other) so the sides match up.
\item Using hand mixer or food processor, combine cheese and butter until well combined. Add heavy cream, Worcestershire sauce, garlic powder, mustard powder, and salt. Mix and test - adjust seasonings to taste. Add hot sauce as/if desired. Once you're happy with the flavor, add egg and mix further until you get a dough-y consistency. 
\item Make mini sandwiches with the cheese mixture. (if you did cut two slices of bread at once, you should have four nicely matched mini sandwiches.) Spread additional cheese mixture on top and sides of each mini sandwich as if you're frosting petit fours. Separately and additionally, take bread crusts and remaining cheese mixture and top remaining mixture over crusts. While less structural integrity, these will be delicious and are best for dippin 
\item Put all your little cheese petit fours on the baking sheet, with at least a 1" moat on all sides of each piece. Can either put in fridge at this step to save for later or cook.
\item Bake ~15-20m. Can add some smoked paprika on top to look fancy. These will be very greasy, so serve appropriately. (I like using a fork here - if you prefer using your fingers just make sure you have napkins.)

\underline{Presentation}\\
For extra fancy presentation: can take single 'cheese dream' petit four and slice into 4, put on top of soup like a crouton after the drizzle of heavy cream but before the chiffonaded basil. Top with basil and black pepper.\\\\
\underline{General}\\
The soup recipe is vegetarian. If you can find vegan Worcestershire sauce, usually made with seaweed, the 'cheese dreams' can be vegetarian too, but normally it contains anchovies. If feeding a mixed crowd, be sure to label as contains fish. Confuse your friends.
