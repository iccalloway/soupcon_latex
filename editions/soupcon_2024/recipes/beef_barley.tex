\recipe{Beef and Barley Soup!}
{Robert Dilg}
{This is a soup my grandma would make us every year when my family would come up for christmas! after spending hours out in the snow sledding, base building, etc, we’d return to the entire house smelling like beef and barley with a hot bowl of soup and hot chocolate with marshmallows waiting for us. It’s an old recipe that I’ve made a bit of my own adjustments to!}
