{This soup is a staple of Lao cuisine. Khao poon nam paa roughly translates to "fish soup with everything", and I like to think of it affectionately as "stinky jungle stew". It's something my dad makes regularly, and its aromas fill any room. It's my first time making the soup, and I'm excited to stink up the room!}
