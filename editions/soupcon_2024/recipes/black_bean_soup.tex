\recipe{Black Bean Soup}
{Justin Craft}
{In late 2019 my now wife told me, “I love your cooking but you really need to try and eat a vegetable sometimes.” She was right. So, I committed to not only cooking more over the next year but cooking more vegetables and maybe even a dish that was just vegetables sometimes. Since then, this soup has become a constant for me. I put it together about once a month or anytime someone I know needs a soup in their life. Some have even said it’s the best thing I cook. I’ll let you decide for yourself if it’s that good.}
