\recipe{Zuppa Toscano}
{Max von Hohenberg}
{ I used to call it Wendy's famous potato and kale soup, until she got mad. Wendy is my mother in law. Now I know what it's actually called and love to make it, but sadly cannot indulge in the spicy side of this soup with kids... Until now! For the first time in nearly 3 years I'm going to use the appropriate Italian sausage and everyone can enjoy the creamy-spicy-soupy delight I've been anticipating for far too long.}
